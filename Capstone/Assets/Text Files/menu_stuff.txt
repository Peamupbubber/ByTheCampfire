One input box:

Enter a pronoun option for your character:

After changing it:

Enter another pronoun option

Keep a list displayed by writing the list to a text box.

Remove a pronoun option -> go through list and find anywhere that option is there

----------

Please enter each set of pronouns for your character:

if I use the 3 version of pronoun option, it avoids making any assumptions and makes it clear how they will be used

TODO: Account for pronoun display overflow once the actual sprites are there

for possessive: check if last letter is 's', if it shouldnt be there in that case remove it.


Create txt file or hardcoded list and check if the entered ones are included


'Enter X's Pronouns:'


For pause menu, have character creation easily accessible and pretty similar to default creation, but start game button changed to 'return to game' or something

Take the prefab of the single pronoun display and have it be instantiated under a layout group parent where it can be used to add a multiplier onto that set of pronouns
 - Keep a list of instances
 - keep a list of references to the input fields, the reference being set and added right after instantiation
 - when the input feild is changed update the multiplier
