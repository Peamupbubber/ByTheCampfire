Color picked object's material is being changed CORRECTLY, just doesn't look like it on the display



Hard code dialogue or create a way to read it in from files? Probably hard code for this small of a game. Create individual scripts for each NPC then, perhaps inherit from an NPC script for basic functions? Like interactability.
 - if they have their own set paths they need that hard coded in individual scripts too.

 On first click:
 1. enter interaction
 1.5. Player cant move
 1.75. enable dialogue box
 2. output text
 3. wait until they click an option
 4. output next piece of dialogue
 5. repeat until last piece of dialogue is done
 6. Player can move
 7. Disable DB


 Change to 3 response optons
 figure out how to wait for button and leave everything else for after but NOT IN THE IENUMERATOR
