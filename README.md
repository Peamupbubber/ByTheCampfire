# Capstone

This is a Unity project developed for my Honors Program Capstone at Western Washington University.

The goal is to create a game with a built in pronoun system that allows the player to create any vision of themselves or their character without traditional bounds that most games plave on the player, among other considerations that I hope to garner a feeling of a more well representative and inclusive game in general.
