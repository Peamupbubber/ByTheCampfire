# By the Campfire

By the Campfire is a video game designed with accurate and thorough representation in mind from the start of development. Its purpose is to showcase the ways in which the player character in a video game can accurately represent anyone who plays it, and that the non-player characters in a video game can be generated in a way that diverse groups can be represented without harmfully misrepresenting them. This project includes a document that explains the process by which this game was created and why certain choices were made when implementing the games systems. The document details a survey that was conducted among college students that provided additional insight as to how representation in video games can be done well or poorly, as well as ideas that could be applied to By the Campfire. The document concludes with thoughts on how this can be expanded upon and applied by the industry and other game developers, as well as a download to play the game. The game features a robust character creation menu as well as randomly generated NPCs that can be interacted with in a game space.
